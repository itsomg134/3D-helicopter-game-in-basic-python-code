## 🎮 Features

- **Realistic 3D Graphics**: Full 3D helicopter model with rotating rotors
- **Physics-Based Flight**: Gravity, momentum, and drag simulation
- **Dynamic Obstacles**: Randomly generated buildings and obstacles to avoid
- **Collectible System**: Golden cubes to collect for points
- **Health System**: Take damage from crashes and collisions
- **Smooth Camera**: Third-person camera that follows the helicopter
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of your performance

## 🎯 Gameplay

- Pilot your helicopter through a 3D environment
- Avoid obstacles (buildings, rocks)
- Collect golden cubes for points
- Manage your health - avoid crashes!
- Try to achieve the highest score possible

## 🕹️ Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `SPACE` | Ascend |
| `W` | Move Forward |
| `S` | Move Backward |
| `A` | Move Left |
| `D` | Move Right |
| `ESC` | Quit Game |
| `R` | Restart (when game over) |

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/3d-helicopter-game.git
cd 3d-helicopter-game
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ▶️ Running the Game

```bash
python helicopter_game.py
```

## 📦 Dependencies

- `pygame` - Game development library
- `PyOpenGL` - Python bindings for OpenGL
- `PyOpenGL_accelerate` - Acceleration package for PyOpenGL

## 🎨 Game Mechanics

### Flight Physics
- **Gravity**: Constant downward force
- **Momentum**: Helicopter maintains velocity with drag
- **Tilt System**: Helicopter tilts based on movement direction

### Scoring System
- Collect golden cubes: **+10 points** each
- Avoid obstacles to maintain health
- Health decreases on collision or ground impact

### Game Over
- Health reaches 0
- Press `R` to restart with new obstacles and collectibles

## 🛠️ Technical Details

- **Graphics**: OpenGL 3D rendering
- **Resolution**: 1200x800 (configurable)
- **FPS**: 60 frames per second
- **Camera**: Third-person following camera
